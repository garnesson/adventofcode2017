# My Advent of Code Solutions

In this repository, I store my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles. I use TypeScript in my solutions.

To get the input to the puzzles, I use [aoc-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aoc-loader). It's a small package that loads and caches the input from the Advent of Code website.

## Use

To run the solution for a given year and day, type:

```sh
npm start <year> <day>
```
